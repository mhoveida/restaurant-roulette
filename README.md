* **Ruby** (version 3.3.9)
* **Rails** (Version 8.x)
* **Node.js** (Version 18.x or later recommended)
* **Yarn** (Version 1.22.x or later)
* **Bundler** (gem for managing dependencies)
* **PostgreSQL** (database server)

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up your development environment.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal and run the following command to download the project files:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mhoveida/restaurant-roulette.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    ```sh
    cd restaurant-roulette
    ```

3.  **Checkout the correct branch**
    ```sh
    git checkout proj-iter1
    ```

4.  **Install Ruby Dependencies**
    Use Bundler to install all the necessary gems specified in the `Gemfile`:
    Make sure you're using 2.7.2 version of bundler, and 3.3.9 version of ruby.

        ```sh
        brew services start postgresql
        ```

    * Next, create the development and test databases for the application:
        ```sh
        rails db:create
        ```

    * Then, Load seed data (restaurants)n:
        ```sh
        rails db:seed
        ```

    * Then, run the database migrations to set up the schema:
        ```sh
        rails db:migrate
        ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Rails Server**
    ```sh
    rails server
    ```

### Running Tests

Make sure your test database is migrated (`rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test`) before running tests.
This project includes both **RSpec** and **Cucumber** tests.

1.  **Run RSpec (Unit Tests):**
    ```bash
    bundle exec rspec
    ```

2.  **Run Cucumber (Feature/Acceptance Tests):**
    ```bash
    bundle exec cucumber
    ```

3.  **Run Both & Check Coverage:**
    * Run all tests (RSpec and Cucumber) and generate a coverage report:
      ```bash
      # Run Cucumber first to generate the report
      bundle exec cucumber
      # Then run RSpec
      bundle exec rspec
      ```
    * Open `coverage/index.html` in your browser to view the detailed report.
